   abstract = {(ricevuto il 12 Aprile 1973) Summary.-The longitudinal equilibrium distribution of electrons stored in a ring is computed in the general case of a nonlinear accelerating field. From this is derived an equation which gives the exact longitudinal density in the presence of longitudinal fields generated by the circulating particles. A method for solving numerically this equation is given and the exact solution is compared to the lowest-approximation solution when self-fields are proportional to the derivative of the bunch density.},

   abstract = {A novel algorithm for self-consistent simulations of long-range wakefield effects has been developed and applied to the study of both longitudinal and transverse coupled-bunch instabilities at NSLS-II. The algorithm is implemented in the new parallel tracking code SPACE (self-consistent parallel algorithm for collective effects) discussed in the paper. The code is applicable for accurate beam dynamics simulations in cases where both bunch-to-bunch and intrabunch motions need to be taken into account, such as chromatic head-tail effects on the coupled-bunch instability of a beam with a nonuniform filling pattern, or multibunch and single-bunch effects of a passive higher-harmonic cavity. The numerical simulations have been compared with analytical studies. For a beam with an arbitrary filling pattern, intensity-dependent complex frequency shifts have been derived starting from a system of coupled Vlasov equations. The analytical formulas and numerical simulations confirm that the analysis is reduced to the formulation of an eigenvalue problem based on the known formulas of the complex frequency shifts for the uniform filling pattern case.},
